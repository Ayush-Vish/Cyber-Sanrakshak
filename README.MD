# Cross-Platform Firewall Solution

## Overview

This project provides a cross-platform firewall solution designed for both Windows and Linux environments. The firewall features deep packet inspection (DPI), real-time predictive deep learning models, and efficient resource usage. It supports automated logging, anomaly detection, alerting, and policy updates.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: 
  - Windows (.exe) and Linux (.deb) distributions.
  - MacOS support and Docker containerization are planned for future releases.

- **Efficient Deep Feature Extraction**: 
  - Utilizes lightweight models for minimal resource usage.
  - Supports hardware acceleration (GPU/TPU) for enhanced performance.
  - Scalable to handle various network sizes and traffic volumes.

- **Real-Time Predictive Deep Learning Model**:
  - Achieves 99% accuracy on standard datasets.
  - Adaptive learning to maintain accuracy over time.
  - Low-latency operation for real-time threat detection.

- **Comprehensive Logging and Alerting**:
  - Detailed logging of network activity.
  - Customizable alert thresholds and notifications.
  - Automated firewall policy updates based on detected threats.
  - Integration with SIEM systems for centralized monitoring.

- **Additional Features**:
  - User-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for management and monitoring.
  - RESTful APIs for integration with other security tools.
  - Multi-tenancy support for managing multiple environments.
  - Compliance reporting for industry standards and regulations.
  - Customizable rules engine for tailored firewall rules.
  - Behavioral analysis for anomaly detection.
  - Encryption of data transmissions.
  - Comprehensive documentation and support resources.
  - Performance monitoring tools.
